::: {#hero-heading}
Hello, I'm Megan! I am a life sciences research professional with many years of experience in plant and microbiology-related research. Recently my professional focus has grown from benchside work to leveraging data analysis and statistical modeling to extract meaning from complex data sets. While I'm proficient in R, I'm actively expanding my knowledge of other skill sets.

When I'm not staring at a screen, I enjoy tending to my patio garden, hiking, and reading. Let's connect and you can tell me about your book recommendations, favorite learning resources, or cool R packages!
